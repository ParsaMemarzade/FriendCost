q -> num of group\n
n -> num person of one of groups\n
m -> num of freindship of one of groups\n

It's program that find a Cost of freind group by graph and this two condition:\n
1 - if A is freinds B then B is friends A.\n
2 - if A is friends B and B is friends C then A is friends with C.\n

1<= q <= 16\n
1<= n <= 10^5\n
1<= m <= min(n(n-1)/2, 2*10^5)\n
