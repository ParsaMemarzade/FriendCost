q -> num of group

n -> num person of one of groups

m -> num of freindship of one of groups


It's program that find a Cost of freind group by graph and this two condition:

1 - if A is freinds B then B is friends A.

2 - if A is friends B and B is friends C then A is friends with C.

1<= q <= 16

1<= n <= 10^5

1<= m <= min(n(n-1)/2, 2*10^5)
